Ok so you have already heard of term probability Distribution but it always confuses you then you are at right place. 


```{python}
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import seaborn as sns
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

```
```{python}
data_url = 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chiphuyen/just-pandas-things/master/data/interviews.csv'
df = pd.read_csv(data_url)
df.head()
```
```{python}
df.groupby(['Company']).size().reset_index(name='interviews').sort_values(['interviews'], ascending=False).head(10)
```
